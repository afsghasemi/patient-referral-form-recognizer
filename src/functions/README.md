# BlobTrigger Function: What happens end-to-end?

1. When a new document is uploaded into the `incoming` container of the Storage Account, it is picked up for processing by the Azure Function (which listens for changes to blobs in this containers).
2. The Azure Function reads the data of the blob and makes a call to the Azure Form Recognizer service via the SDK.
3. Form Recognizer performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the document and returns a result set with the text and fields it extracted. Because we trained a custom model, the custom fields we defined are returned in the response too.
4. When the response from Form Recognizer has been received by the calling function, it's overall confidence score is extracted from the result set:
   - If falls below our arbitrary "acceptable" threshold (default 0.8 or 80% overall confidence), it is deemed too inaccurate and moved to the `manual` container for manual / human downstream processing.
   - If it it greater than or equal to our pre-defined threshold, it's custom fields are extracted and appended to an Azure Table Storage (this could be any database); and the document itself is moved to the `processed` container.
5. The file, regardless of the outcome is tagged (metadata) with the overall confidence score when it is moved between containers.
6. Once processing has completed and the file has been moved, it will disappear from the `incoming` (source) container.
